In this paper, they reserach the interconnectedness of ingustry and geography, exploring the "why" behind  
large geographic clusters of specific types of industry (Tech companies in SF, Space companies in LA, etc).  
They used LinkedIn's emplyment history data of 500,000 people over 25 years to model labor flow networks. 
Labor flow networks are directed, weighted graphs where the nodes represent firms and the edges represent  
employee movement between companies. Their conclusions are that their model has some explanitory power to  
predict economic growth based on labor flows of higher-education employees moving to specific geographic regions.  
I would say their results are validated in the sense that they are using a large set of training data and gleaning insight  
from past events, but prediction is generally a hard thing to validate.
